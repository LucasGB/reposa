On average, 70% of the pull requests came from a contributor who would never contribute again to the repository (once-contributors). We related this to receiving a
negative comment on the first contribution (pull request)
and also to the project characteristics, KLoc, number of
contributors, and stargazers. We found that as the project
grew in KLoc(Thousand lines of code) the number on oncecontributors with negative comments on the first pull request grew, from 10.97% on projects with less than 30.57
KLoc to 24.02% on projects bigger than 197.78 KLoc, we
present the progression in Figure 6 in the bars, and the line
shows the percent of projects in the respective KLoc range,
we did not find a relationship between number of contributors or stargazers with the percentage of once-contributors.
